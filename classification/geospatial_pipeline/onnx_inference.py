    Run model inference over an input data cube.

    Applies a neighborhood UDF with the specified patch size and overlap and cuts off the overlap. The UDF
    should load and apply the model defined by the `model_name`.

    Args:
        input_cube: The input DataCube on which inference will be applied.
        model_name: Name of the ONNX model file (without extension) located in the folder 'dynamic_models/' within the model zip.
        patch_size: Size (in pixels) of the square window used for neighborhood inference.
        overlap: Number of pixels to overlap between patches (sliding window). Increasing this value, will result is less artefacts at the edges of patches, but will also increase the computation time.

    Returns:
        DataCube: Output data cube after inference.
